# Protection

We take breaches of privacy very seriously and will take all reasonable steps and employ appropriate security measures to ensure that your Personal Data is securely stored and protected against unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks. You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures. In the event of a data breach we shall notify you if required by and in accordance with the data protection laws applicable to you.

Should you decide to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please inform us in writing in the manner described above.
